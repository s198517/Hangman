    <string name="rulesList">Your task is to complete the word by guessing one letter at a time. For each time you guess a letter that doesn\'t exists in that word, you\'re one step closer becoming a hanged man. So be patient and smart, cause you only get to guess 7 times. If you guess the word within 7 guesses, then you won. Either if you win or lose, a new word will appear for you to guess.</string>
